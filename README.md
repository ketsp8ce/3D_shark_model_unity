This project recreates my earlier 3D shark model (originally built in OpenGL) using Unity, reproducing the camera movement, lighting, and texturing of the original artifact.
The previous artifact is located in a previous repository - https://github.com/ketsp8ce/3D-shark-model-openGL
 

    Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
    - My original artifact was the final product of a 3D modeling class (cs330), whereapoun I created a 3D model of my frilled shark plushie using openGL. 
    Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?
    Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
    Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
