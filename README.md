This project recreates my earlier 3D shark model (originally built in OpenGL) using Unity, reproducing the camera movement, lighting, and texturing of the original artifact.
The previous artifact is located in a previous repository - https://github.com/ketsp8ce/3D-shark-model-openGL
 

    Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
    - My original artifact was the final product of a 3D modeling class (cs330), whereapoun I created a 3D model of my frilled shark plushie using openGL. 
    Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?
    I chose this artifact because of its alignment to the topic of data structures and algorithms. 3 dimensional modeling in openGL nessesiates the instantiation of a vector space, and the subsequent creation of vector based 3D objects. This required real-time understanding of an application of linear algebra. The ceration of the original artifact gave me an oppurtunity to apply my linear alebra skills in real time for this reason. In Unity, the same underlying concepts apply such as shaders and mesh objects, but the user operates with these concepts at a much higher level of abstraction, with the option to complete works using only the GUI. For this reason, Unity has an easier learning curve. I am glad I had the oppurtunity to learn openGL prior to Unity, but since Unity was easier to use, I was able to ,make a better final product in Unity. 
    
    Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
    In module 1, the enhancment plan for this artifact's enhancement, I said;
    "I believe my proposed project enhancement aligns with the following course outcome: 

-----'Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.'"


    Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
